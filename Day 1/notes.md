## Functions in javaScript

In javaScript the function can be call before it is decalre but it must be define like this :

`function myFunc(theArr) { ` <br/>
  `theArr[0] = 30;` <br />
`}`

This is called <b>Hoisting</b>

When we define a function in a variable it first go into memory phase and the value is `undefined` initially.
